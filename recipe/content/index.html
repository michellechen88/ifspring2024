            <h2>Recipe Site Links</h2>
            <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/">recipetineats</a>
            <p>I like how this recipe site keeps the nav bar on the screen the whole time while you scroll, so it makes it easy for users to search up any recipe without having to scroll all the way back to the top. The images on the site are a bit too large for my taste and it can make it feel too cluttered. Lastly, I like they sectioned different recipes into multiple categories which helps users feel like they can work less to find a meal idea.</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/">The Woks of Life</a>
            <p>This recipe site organizes information in a simple column or two column grid which makes it easier on the eye when scrolling through. The larger side margins when the site is viewed in full screen gives a nice amount of breathing space for our eyes. I love the illustrations at the top of the nav bar but because the line weight is similar to the text, it took me a bit to realize it wasn't just a decorative banner, and that it had drop down menus to use as navigation.</p>

            <p>I really enjoy the simple aesthetic of this site and how each recipe on the main page has tags that can help someone identify what type of food they'll be making. The navigation is also really simple with a hamburger bar at the top right, and I think overall the simplicity really fits this creator's whole aethetic.</p>

            <h2>Other Sites</h2>
                <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a>
                <p>Once again, I just really like the simplicity of MoMA's site where they use a really structured grid to organize content but then add splashes of color to create visual interest. Additionally, I think the typeface used is a very legible one, especially with how they use a bigger point size.</p>
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>
                <p>Another example of a very sleek and simple site design. I love how they have content that peeks out from the bottom to make users aware that they should scroll down to continue reading. The site makes navigation feel very easy overall.</p>

                <a href="https://whoisnerdy.us/">Nerdy</a>
                <p>I really like the fun colors of this site and also the scrolling interactions/animations that are incorporated. Although the scrolling mechanics might not be the most intuitive, it was fun seeing and noticing how it would cause different animations to occur. I also think the site reflects this clothing brand's simple yet sporty aesthetic.</p>
