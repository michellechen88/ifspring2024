            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix peanut butter, soysauce and sesame oil in a bowl; taste the sauce until you find a good balance of flavors. Set the sauce bowl aside.</li>
                    <li>Boil a pot of water and add in noodles</li>
                    <li>Cook for 1 minute (or 2 minutes if frozen) just until noodles are warm and fliant (save a cup of pasta water)</li>
                    <li>When the noodles are done, scoop them up and plop them into the sauce bowl. Add a spoonful of pasta water to make the sauce more runny (add as little or as much pasta water as you want to get the sauce to a consistency you like).</li>
