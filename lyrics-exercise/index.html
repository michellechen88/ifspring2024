                <h3 class>[Verse 1]</h3>
                <p>Meeting up, like we're seventeen again</p>
                <p>Solo cups, but now we put beer in them</p>
                <p>Laying back and daring me to</p>
                <p>Dive into the deep end</p>
                <p>Reaching out, how you been holding up?</p>
                <p>'Cause I heard you'd recently broken up</p>
                <p>With the boy you grew apart from</p>
                <p>So much for your first love</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
                <p>And we laugh like little kids</p>
                <p>Bad jokes for the hell of it</p>
                <p>Mom says come inside, we say "in a minute"</p>
                <p>But I wish that I could</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
                <p>Close my eyes, ignore the sirens</p>
                <p>Watch the sun leave the horizon</p>
                <p>We won't go unless wе're dying</p>
                <p>But we both know that time was nеver kind</p>
                <p>And you know in July</p>
                <p>Those summer nights belong to you and I</p>

                <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
                <p>Moving out and counting the miles, thisn</p>
                <p>Little town takes all of your breath with it</p>
                <p>Fatal flaw, I'm sick of it all</p>
                <p>But now that I'm leaving, I'm missing</p>
            </div>

                <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
                <p>All the late nights in</p>
                <p>Let our deepest secrets slip</p>
                <p>Holding tight, this was nice, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>But I wish that I could</p>

                <p>Hold on a little longer</p>
                <p>You're slipping through my fingers</p>
                <p>The tide will pull us under</p>
                <p>What's left of you will linger</p>
