            <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
            <em>Answer the following questions, with your answers formatted as an ordered list in an HTML document that you upload to the server.</em>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school.</strong></li>
                <p>Michelle Chen, Communication Design, Junior.</p>
                <li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong></li>
                <p>I'm currently a Comm Des Major (and minoring in HCI) and this class is one of the required studios for the major, but that isn't the only reason
                    I'm taking this class. I'm interested in possibly pursuing a career in UI/UX and wanted to learn more about front end work
                    that goes into designing websites.</p>
                <li><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></li>
                <p>I don't have any experience, but am very excited to learn and create!</p>
                <li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></li>
                <p>I really want to learn how to create interactive websites where it really engages users either through
                    surprising visuals or from them discovering cool interactions they can have with buttons or scrolling!
                    Most importantly, I hope to learn how to design visually aesthetic and easily navigatable sites!
                </p>
                <li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></li>
                <p>I think the biggest difference is the scaling of page content. Although designers need to think about
                    scaling when it comes to making something for a poster vs a business card, I think there's more to consider
                    when it's a webpage because users can immediately change browser compared to a poster which will 
                    only be viewed at the size it was made for. So thinking about how to format content to be adaptable and legible
                    will be crucial.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p>I really enjoy the design of this site called <a href="https://itsnotviolent.com/"> Violence Conjugale</a>.</p>
                    <p>The site is very interactive and engaging with all the motion effects, but despite
                    being so busy, I still think the navigation is simple and intuitive enough while allowing
                    users to still try and discover new functions on the site. To me, this site is effectively designed
                    with how both functionality and visual aesthetics were taken into consideration. I think it's also very effective
                    at educating people on differnt forms of violence through it's interactive activities that puts
                    users in a simulated situation to give them a sense of what it could potentially feel like. I also
                    really like how they have links to help resources for anyone who is in need of them.
                    </p>
                <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p><a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA's</a> site is one that I think shows effective communication.</p>
                <p>The clean design makes it really easy to navigate and organize the what the museum wants people to know. Additionally,
                    as an art museum's website, there's an emphasis on visual aesthetics which is also achieved through the hierarchy, colors,
                    and type choice for the content. I just really love the simple yet elegant design of the site.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p>I think the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times's</a> site works very well.</p>
                <p>When I was playing around with the browser size as well as looking at the site from a phone, the content
                    on the page responded and reformatted in a way that was very legible and understandable. The navigation of
                    the site is also very simple to understand and functions as it should.
