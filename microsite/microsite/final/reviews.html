                <h2>Critical Response</h2>
                <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender received universal acclaim. As of July 2020, the show has a critics score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews.[47] Max Nicholson of IGN called it a "must-watch" and described it as "one of the greatest animated series of all time".[48] Nick Hartel of DVD Talk called the series a remarkable, "child friendly show" whose legacy "should endure for years to come".[37] Erik Amaya of Bleeding Cool described the series as "impressive in its sophistication" and "fantastic".[49] Henry Glasheen of SLUG Magazine called the series "adventurous and exciting", a "classic" and occasionally moving.[50] According to Brittany Lovely of Hypable, it tells "complex and beautiful" stories.[51] Joe Corey of Inside Pulse described the series as an anime-action hybrid.[52] Chris Mitchell of Popzara called it one of the best shows to air on Nickelodeon, praising the series' background music and voice acting.[53] D.

                <p>The show's writing and themes have been widely lauded by critics. Michael S. Mammano of Den of Geek called the plot "smartly-written" and praised the animation.[64] Nicole Clark, writing for Vice News, stated that the show's narrative depth was "its greatest asset", and praised the story's "emotional authenticity" and how it "expose[d] very young viewers to darker subject matter, like genocide and authoritarianism, while giving them a framework for understanding these issues."[3] Jenifer Rosenberg of ComicMix liked the program's emphasis on family, friends, community, and education.[65] According to Nick Hartel, the series touches on themes of "genocide and self-doubt" without frightening younger children; rogue characters are redeemable, sending an important message that people can change and are not bonded to "destiny".[37] Chris Mitchell called the plot "fantastic".[53] D.

The series' concept is "well-realized", with a consistent story. Douglass wrote that the characters "[have] a real sense of progression", and praised the writers for their humor, drama, and emotion.[58] Joshua Miller called the series surprisingly dark despite its "silly" theme; the plot is livelier than that of Lost and, similar to the latter show, emphasizes character development.

                <p>Critics also praised Avatar: The Last Airbender's character development, art, animation, and choreography; Eric Amaya enjoyed the expressive animation that complements the writing. According to Amaya, the elements were influenced by Hayao Miyazaki.[49] Todd Douglass, Jr. called the character development interesting,[58] while Nicole Clark wrote that the show "managed to do what so few shows even today have: assemble a cast of characters that depicts the world as it is, with a range of identities and experiences."[3] Jenifer Rosenburg praised the series' portrayal of females as "strong, responsible, [and] intelligent".[65] According to Joshua Miller, the bender characters' use of bending for everyday activities brings "depth and believability" to the Avatar world. Miller called the series' designs "rich and immersive", with each nation having its own, detailed look. He praised the action scenes as "well rendered", comparing the development of the Avatar world to that of The Lord of the Rings, and the fight choreography as "wonderful in its most minor details".[59] D. F. Smith enjoyed the series' painstaking backgrounds.[54] "Cricket" Te praised each episode's color palette and the choreography's combination of martial arts and magic.[62] Nick Hartel criticized the animation, although he found it an improvement over previous Nickelodeon shows.[37] Chris Mitchell called the animation fluid.[53] "Cricket" Te agreed, noting its manga influence.[62] According to Brittany Lovely, non-bender characters in battle are "overshadowed" by their bender counterparts.[51] Joe Corey called the animation's action and environments a "great achievement",[52] and Rob Keyes praised the series' fight choreography.[55] According to Kirk Hamilton, the action sequences in the series are amazing while being child-appropriate and exciting.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>

                <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender has become a cult classic and had a large impact in the 2010s on how networks viewed animated programs; subsequent children's shows would often blur the lines between youth and adult programming, featuring more adult themes.</p>
                <p>Multiple media publications have hailed Avatar as one of the best (animated) television series of all time.[68][3][69][70][71][72][73] In 2013, TV Guide included Avatar among the 60 greatest cartoon of all-time list.[74] In 2018, Vanity Fair ranked the series as the 11th-best animated TV show.[75] IndieWire ranked Avatar at number 36 on its 2018 list of the "50 Best Animated Series Of All Time".</p>
                <p>The series experienced a resurgence in popularity following its addition to Netflix on May 15, 2020; it reached the number-one position on the platform's top series in the U.S. four days after release, and was the most-popular film or show for the week of May 14–21.[77] The series maintained a spot within Netflix's top ten series for a record-setting 60 days, the most of any show since the company debuted its list of top series in February 2020.[15] The series would become the most-streamed children's series on the platform for the year.[78] Both fans and co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko attributed Avatar's renewed popularity to its relevance to contemporary events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and racial unrest in the U.S., with DiMartino remarking: "The major issues in the stories—genocide, totalitarianism, systemic injustice, abuse—sadly, these have been pervasive issues throughout history and continue to be. The show is a reflection of our world. But now, we happen to be living through a time in which all these problems have been exacerbated."</p>
